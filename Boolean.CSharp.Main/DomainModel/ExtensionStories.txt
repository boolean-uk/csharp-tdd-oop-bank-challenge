When I refer to Extensions

Extension 1
As an engineer,
So I don't need to keep track of state,
I want account balances to be calculated based on transaction history instead of stored in memory.

Extension 2
As a bank manager,
So I can expand,
I want accounts to be associated with specific branches.

Extension 3
As a customer,
So I have an emergency fund,
I want to be able to request an overdraft on my account.

Extension 4
As a bank manager,
So I can safeguard our funds,
I want to approve or reject overdraft requests.

Extension 5
As a customer,
So I can stay up to date,
I want statements to be sent as messages to my phone.
