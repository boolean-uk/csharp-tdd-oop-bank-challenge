```
As an engineer,
So I don't need to keep track of state,
I want account balances to be calculated based on transaction history instead of stored in memory.

As a bank manager,
So I can expand,
I want accounts to be associated with specific branches.

As a customer,
So I have an emergency fund,
I want to be able to request an overdraft on my account.

As a bank manager,
So I can safeguard our funds,
I want to approve or reject overdraft requests.

As a customer,
So I can stay up to date,
I want statements to be sent as messages to my phone.
