# Instructions on how to try the scenarios:
1. Start the application... (main function in Scenarios.cs)
1. Select an option from the list in the terminal. Just the number will do.
1. Keep selecting options and enter input fitting the example format.
1. To actually do much of anything, you will need to create and account first. I recommend copying the account ID as it is used in almost all other options.
1. Explore! You might break it, as it is not rigorously tested.
